I am forking this just for editing some values like preventing the cursor from selecting the skills on the bottom of the screen.
The Goal of this fork is JUST for playing on citra with a mouse and keyboard.


## What is This Project?
Simply put, Kelkador made some AHK scripts that allow the 3DS classic Kid Icarus Uprising to be playing with mouse and keyboard, with very little problems. There is some software that you'll need to get this working fully, but once you download everything it'll be fairly plug and play. Please download the scripts from the "releases" page. Note: Kelkador's video you are probably linked to from this is ENTIRELY OUTDATED!!!

## What Software is Needed?
1. Citra (Google a recent version, make sure it has seperate windows screen layout.) (Always needed)
(version Canary 2798)
