I am forking this just for editing some values like preventing the cursor from selecting the skills on the bottom of the screen.
The Goal of this fork is JUST for playing on citra with a mouse and keyboard.


## What is This Project?
Simply put, I made some AHK scripts that allow the 3DS classic Kid Icarus Uprising to be playing with mouse and keyboard, with very little problems. There is some software that you'll need to get this working fully, but once you download everything it'll be fairly plug and play. Please download the scripts from the "releases" page. Note: My video you are probably linked to from this is ENTIRELY OUTDATED!!! This is a complete, updated guide below

## What Software is Needed?
1. Citra (Google a recent version, make sure it has seperate windows screen layout.) (Always needed)
(version Canary 2798)


## Special thanks

evilC, for making the ViGEm AHK Wrapper

nefarius, for ViGEm itself

Sakurai, for being a real one

## I have a question/FAQ!!!!

When setting controls in Steam make SURE "Use Desktop Configuration in Launcher" is UNCHECKED!

If Citra is acting strangely, check the default Citra System hotkeys. Ctrl + W is bound to an action by default, make sure you unbind that!

If controls are unresponsive after previously working, try shutting off and turning back on your system!

ONLY use the release of AHK included with the zip and make sure you are launching the script with that!

If you have the seperate screens of Citra on seperate monitors, try switching the graphics backend from OpenGL to Vulkan! May fix lag issues!

Lastly, if a part of the script you believe is inaccurate, make sure there is as little "dead" black space in the Citra touch screen window as you can get!

For anything else, DM or @ me on tweeter https://twitter.com/Kelkador
