## What is This Project?
Simply put, I made some AHK scripts that allow the 3DS classic Kid Icarus Uprising to be playing with mouse and keyboard or dual analogue, with very little problems. There is some software that you'll need to get this working fully, but once you download it it'll be fairly plug and play.

## What Software is Needed?
1. AutoHotKey's current release (NOT 2.0) (https://www.autohotkey.com/) (needed no matter what)
2. Citra (https://citra-emu.org/) (if playing on emu)
3. Input Redirection Client QT (https://github.com/gbrown5/InputRedirectionClient-Qt) (if playing on original hardware)
4. Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/) (for dual analogue controls)
5. Universal Controller Remapper AHK Version by evilC (https://github.com/evilC/UCR)(for mouse and keyboard controls)
6. vJoy (http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download) (for mouse and keyboard controls)
